# contiki_cont
Contiki 2.7 with RPL modified for router containers described in RFC6551

- Can use some different metrics/constraints (optional/mandatory) to select paths.
- Can use one of two defined Objective Function: additive or lexicographic
- Simulates battery consumption so it can be used too as metric/constraint.
- Can extract a lot of data for graphics. 

I just modified Contiki and made something that I hope could be useful for someone, so I've uploaded all this. I know I don't follow the rules to make a fork of Contiki and the Wiki is poor... but if it's useful for you, just let me know.
