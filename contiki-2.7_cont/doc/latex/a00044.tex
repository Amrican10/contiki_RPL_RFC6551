\-The \-Contiki build system is designed to make it easy to compile \-Contiki applications for either to a hardware platform or into a simulation platform by simply supplying different parameters to the {\ttfamily make} command, without having to edit makefiles or modify the application code.

\-The file example project in examples/hello-\/world/ shows how the \-Contiki build system works. \-The {\ttfamily hello-\/world.\-c} application can be built into a complete \-Contiki system by running {\ttfamily make} in the examples/hello-\/world/ directory. \-Running {\ttfamily make} without parameters will build a \-Contiki system using the {\ttfamily native} target. \-The {\ttfamily native} target is a special \-Contiki platform that builds an entire \-Contiki system as a program that runs on the development system. \-After compiling the application for the {\ttfamily native} target it is possible to run the \-Contiki system with the application by running the file {\ttfamily hello-\/world.\-native}. \-To compile the application and a \-Contiki system for the \-E\-S\-B platform" the command {\ttfamily make \-T\-A\-R\-G\-E\-T=esb} is used. \-This produces a hello-\/world.\-esb file that can be loaded into an \-E\-S\-B board.

\-To compile the hello-\/world application into a stand-\/alone executable that can be loaded into a running \-Contiki system, the command {\ttfamily make hello-\/world.\-ce} is used. \-To build an executable file for the \-E\-S\-B platform, {\ttfamily make \-T\-A\-R\-G\-E\-T=esb hello-\/world.\-ce} is run.

\-To avoid having to type {\ttfamily \-T\-A\-R\-G\-E\-T=} every time {\ttfamily make} is run, it is possible to run {\ttfamily make \-T\-A\-R\-G\-E\-T=esb savetarget} to save the selected target as the default target platform for subsequent invocations of {\ttfamily make}. \-A file called {\ttfamily \-Makefile.\-target} containing the currently saved target is saved in the project's directory.\hypertarget{a00044_buildsystem-makefiles}{}\subsubsection{\-Makefiles used in the Contiki build system}\label{a00044_buildsystem-makefiles}
\-The \-Contiki build system is composed of a number of \-Makefiles. \-These are\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \-Makefile}\-: the project's makefile, located in the project directory.
\item {\ttfamily \-Makefile.\-include}\-: the system-\/wide \-Contiki makefile, located in the root of the \-Contiki source tree.
\item {\ttfamily \-Makefile.\$(\-T\-A\-R\-G\-E\-T)} (where \$(\-T\-A\-R\-G\-E\-T) is the name of the platform that is currently being built)\-: rules for the specific platform, located in the platform's subdirectory in the platform/ directory.
\item {\ttfamily \-Makefile.\$(\-C\-P\-U)} (where \$(\-C\-P\-U) is the name of the \-C\-P\-U or microcontroller architecture used on the platform for which \-Contiki is built)\-: rules for the \-C\-P\-U architecture, located in the \-C\-P\-U architecture's subdirectory in the cpu/ directory.
\item {\ttfamily \-Makefile.\$(\-A\-P\-P)} (where \$(\-A\-P\-P) is the name of an application in the apps/ directory)\-: rules for applications in the apps/ directories. \-Each application has its own makefile.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\-The \-Makefile in the project's directory is intentionally simple. \-It specifies where the \-Contiki source code resides in the system and includes the system-\/wide \-Makefile, {\ttfamily \-Makefile.\-include}. \-The project's makefile can also define in the {\ttfamily \-A\-P\-P\-S} variable a list of applications from the apps/ directory that should be included in the \-Contiki system. \-The \-Makefile used in the hello-\/world example project looks like this\-:


\begin{DoxyCode}
CONTIKI = ../..
all: hello-world
include $(CONTIKI)/Makefile.include
\end{DoxyCode}


\-First, the location of the \-Contiki source code tree is given by defining the {\ttfamily \-C\-O\-N\-T\-I\-K\-I} variable. \-Next, the name of the application is defined. \-Finally, the system-\/wide {\ttfamily \-Makefile.\-include} is included.

\-The {\ttfamily \-Makefile.\-include} contains definitions of the \-C files of the core \-Contiki system. {\ttfamily \-Makefile.\-include} always reside in the root of the \-Contiki source tree. \-When {\ttfamily make} is run, {\ttfamily \-Makefile.\-include} includes the {\ttfamily \-Makefile.\$(\-T\-A\-R\-G\-E\-T)} as well as all makefiles for the applications in the {\ttfamily \-A\-P\-P\-S} list (which is specified by the project's {\ttfamily \-Makefile}).

{\ttfamily \-Makefile.\$(\-T\-A\-R\-G\-E\-T)}, which is located in the platform/\$(\-T\-A\-R\-G\-E\-T)/ directory, contains the list of \-C files that the platform adds to the \-Contiki system. \-This list is defined by the {\ttfamily \-C\-O\-N\-T\-I\-K\-I\-\_\-\-T\-A\-R\-G\-E\-T\-\_\-\-S\-O\-U\-R\-C\-E\-F\-I\-L\-E\-S} variable. \-The {\ttfamily \-Makefile.\$(\-T\-A\-R\-G\-E\-T)} also includes the {\ttfamily \-Makefile.\$(\-C\-P\-U)} from the cpu/\$(\-C\-P\-U)/ directory.

\-The {\ttfamily \-Makefile.\$(\-C\-P\-U)} typically contains definitions for the \-C compiler used for the particular \-C\-P\-U. \-If multiple \-C compilers are used, the {\ttfamily \-Makefile.\$(\-C\-P\-U)} can either contain a conditional expression that allows different \-C compilers to be defined, or it can be completely overridden by the platform specific makefile {\ttfamily \-Makefile.\$(\-T\-A\-R\-G\-E\-T)}.
